## Graal Integration (in progress)

Graal is a Generic Repository AnALyzer for Grimoirelab. He uses among other things `coloc` or `lizard` tools.

The actual docker don't include the Graal integration but a first version of this integration is proposed as a fork here : https://github.com/florentk/grimoirelab (see `docker` subdirectory) based on the work of inishchith at Google Summer code 2019.
